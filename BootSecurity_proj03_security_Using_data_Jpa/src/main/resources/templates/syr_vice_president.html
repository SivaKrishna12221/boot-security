   Vice president role hierarchy
Just as there is an organizational hierarchy, there are different levels of vice presidents, depending on the industry.

The lower rungs include:

Associate VP: This is a role seen mostly in higher education but can be in any industry where there are geographically separate locations, such as retail. They’re responsible for long-range planning and overseeing operations of specific geographical locations as well as program and staff development.
Assistant VP: This position is akin to a regional director who oversees different areas in a business, such as marketing, HR or operations, and manages highly trained staff. In some cases, it’s used interchangeably with the Associate VP title.
First VP: The FVP is a mainstay in the finance sector. This can be a designation given to someone who’s been promoted or demoted, depending on the organization. It can also be a promotion-in-place situation that’s more for recognition than for ascension.
Difference between the SVP and EVP
Senior vice president (SVP) and executive vice president (EVP) are two of the higher echelon positions.

SVP: Someone in a regular VP role for a certain number of years could be eligible to be a senior VP. SVPs positions are strategic roles and may be responsible for full departments, making it more challenging.
EVP: An EVP reports directly to the president or C-suite executives and has the power to make major company decisions. In cases where the president has moved on to another company or a higher position, the EVP would be the next in line to take those reins.
